Flower Shop Website This is a business card website for selling flowers, designed with a unique aesthetic and a focus on delivering a personalized user experience. The website features multilingual support, beautiful animations, and a custom design to enhance the shopping experience.

The technologies used include HTML with Bootstrap 5 for responsive layouts, and SCSS for easy styling adjustments. The website is designed in such a way that the client can easily modify the content as needed. There are two main JavaScript files: one handles language switching and dynamically adds the language code to the URL (#language), while the other contains the text data for different languages.
